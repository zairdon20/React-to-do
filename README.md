This repo holds all the code for a React todos application. You can follow the step by step [guide to building the awesome project here](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/).

## [Click to See the Todos App](https://zairdon20.github.io/react-todo-project/)

The code is available in the `src` folder. In there, you‚Äôll see two folders named `classBased` and `functionBased` holding the class component and function component code respectively.

### Clone the project

You can download or clone this project by running this command from your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ibaslogic/react-todo-app

This will create a directory in the name of the project folder.

Once you have the project files and folders bootstrapped, open it with your text editor.

```

This will install all the necessary dependencies in the local `node_modules` folder.
